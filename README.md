## Introduction

Welcome to Sushie Haven, a modern, fully responsive HTML & CSS website with stunning animations! This project showcases the artistry of sushi and combines it with web design excellence.

## Technologies and Techniques

Sushie Haven was created using various technologies and techniques to achieve its polished look and interactivity. Here are some key aspects of the project:

- **HTML & CSS**: The foundation of the website is built upon HTML for structure and CSS for styling. Together, they provide the layout, content, and visual appeal of Sushie Haven.

- **CSS Variables**: CSS variables were utilized to maintain consistency and make it easier to adjust colors, fonts, and other design elements across the entire website.

- **CSS Importing**: CSS files were imported into other CSS files to keep the codebase organized and modular. This approach enhances maintainability and reusability.

- **Flexbox & Positioning**: CSS Flexbox and positioning properties were employed to create responsive layouts and precisely position elements on the page.

- **Subtle Animations**: Subtle animations were added to enhance the user experience, making the website more engaging and visually appealing.

- **File and Folder Structure**: Sushie Haven follows a well-organized file and folder structure, making it easy for developers to locate and work with specific components and styles.

- **Clean Code Writing Principles**: The project adheres to clean code writing principles, promoting readability and maintainability. Descriptive class names and comments are used to explain the code's purpose.

### BEM (Block Element Modifier)

Sushie Haven also employs the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology in its CSS code. BEM is a naming convention for CSS classes that helps maintain a scalable and maintainable codebase. Here's a brief explanation:

- **Block**: The main component or "block" of a webpage, e.g., `.header`, `.menu`, or `.footer`.

- **Element**: Smaller, reusable parts within a block, e.g., within a `.menu` block, you might have `.menu__item` elements.

- **Modifier**: Variations or modifications of blocks and elements, e.g., `.menu--dark` to indicate a dark-themed menu.

By following the BEM methodology, Sushie Haven keeps CSS classes organized and ensures that changes and additions to styles are intuitive and predictable.
